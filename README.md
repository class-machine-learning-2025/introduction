# Machine Learning

## Introduction

- Lecturer : Prof. Byung-Woo Hong
- E-mail : hong@cau.ac.kr
- Office : building 310, office 739

## Class Objective

- We will study mathematical foundations of machine learning and its applications

## Contents

- Linear Algebra
- Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Regularization
- Neural Networks : Representation
- Neural Networks : Learning
- Support Vector Machine
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction

## Flipped Learning

- Students are expected to study the machine learning theory independently using the online lectures
- Students are expected to implement programming assignments in Python to improve the practical skills

## Tools

- Class management
  - google classroom (class code: `st2v544`)
  - [github](https://github.com), [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

- Programming
  - [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - python3 ([anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com))
  - jupyter notebook
  - [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

## Grading Policy

- assignments
- exams (if necessary)
- failing to attend the class 4 times or more results in Fail

### Assignments

- Submission should be made to Google Classroom
- Programming processes are committed at GitHub
- Late submissions result in the zero score
- Failure (no submission or zero score) of half or more assignments results in the fail of the class
- Discussions among students are not allowed
- Cheating will result in the immediate failure of the class
- Deadline is set to be 11:59 pm at Google Classroom, but the actual deadline is always 11:30 pm instead

### Exams
